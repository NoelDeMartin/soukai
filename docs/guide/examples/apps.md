# Apps

Perhaps the best place to look for sample code is within real apps! There are a couple of apps that have been built using Soukai. If you know others that aren't in this list, feel free [to open a PR](https://github.com/NoelDeMartin/soukai/pulls).

## Focus

[Focus](https://focus.noeldemartin.com/) is the OG, the first app developed with Soukai. I recently rewrote it using [Aerogel](https://aerogel.js.org), a framework I'm working on with Soukai at its core.

## Ramen

[Ramen](https://ramen.noeldemartin.com/) is, quite possibly, the simplest app using Soukai out there. It may even be a stretch to call it "a real app", but it's the perfect place to look at how the library can be used in a codebase that is built with production in mind.

## Umai

[Umai](https://umai.noeldemartin.com/) is a local-first recipes manager, and as of this writing (March 2025), it's the most recent and complete app built with Soukai. If you're looking for an actual app with a bunch of features, this is the codebase for you.

## Media Kraken

[Media Kraken](https://noeldemartin.github.io/media-kraken/) is a media tracker that was built some years ago. It doesn't boast the most modern of codebases, but it is still maintained and it can be a great compliment with Umai if you are looking for real code.
