# Going Further

If you want to learn more about the library the best way is to look at some code!
 Here you can find some working examples:

<details>
  <summary>Hello World</summary>
  <br>
  <iframe src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/soukaihelloworld-1eqtg?autoresize=1&expanddevtools=1&fontsize=14" title="soukai-hello-world" style="width:100%; height:500px; border:0; border-radius: 4px; overflow:hidden;" sandbox="allow-modals allow-forms allow-popups allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Users & Posts</summary>

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Sandbox</summary>
  <br>
  <iframe src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/soukai-sandbox-hw7n1?fontsize=14&view=editor&module=%2Fsrc%2Findex.ts" title="soukai-hello-world" style="width:100%; height:500px; border:0; border-radius: 4px; overflow:hidden;" sandbox="allow-modals allow-forms allow-popups allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe>
</details>

Other than that, don't be afraid to go into the source code. It's written in TypeScript, so you'll probably learn more by looking at it. You may find test files (ending in `.test.ts`) particularly helpful.

## Extending the Library

In order to extend the library for specific use cases, you probably only need to extend one or two contracts: the [Engine](https://soukai.js.org/api/interfaces/Engine) interface and the [Model](https://soukai.js.org/api/classes/Model) class.

If you want to find some existing extensions, search for the [#soukai](https://github.com/topics/soukai) and [#soukai-engine](https://github.com/topics/soukai-engine) topics in GitHub and elsewhere.

## Contributing

Feel free to report any bugs or open pull requests in the [Github repository](https://github.com/noeldemartin/soukai).

If you are thinking on developing new functionality, you should start by [opening an issue](https://github.com/NoelDeMartin/soukai/issues/new) to discuss it. We won't accept any contributions right out the door, so it's better to discuss it before you start working on it.
