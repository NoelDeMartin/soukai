There are a couple of apps that have been built using Soukai. If you know others that aren&#39;t in this list, feel free <a href="https://github.com/NoelDeMartin/soukai/pulls" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">to open a PR</a>.</p><h2 id="ramen" tabindex="-1">Ramen <a class="header-anchor" href="#ramen" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Ramen&quot;">​</a></h2><p><a href="https://ramen.noeldemartin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Ramen</a> is, quite possibly, the simplest app using Soukai out there. It may even be a stretch to call it &quot;a real app&quot;, but it&#39;s the perfect place to look at how the library can be used in a codebase that is built with production in mind.</p><h2 id="umai" tabindex="-1">Umai <a class="header-anchor" href="#umai" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Umai&quot;">​</a></h2><p><a href="https://umai.noeldemartin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Umai</a> is a local-first recipes manager, and as of this writing (March 2025), it&#39;s the most recent and complete app built with Soukai. If you&#39;re looking for an actual app with a bunch of features, this is the codebase for you.</p><h2 id="media-kraken" tabindex="-1">Media Kraken <a class="header-anchor" href="#media-kraken" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Media Kraken&quot;">​</a></h2><p><a href="https://noeldemartin.github.io/media-kraken/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Media Kraken</a> is a media tracker that was built some years ago. It doesn&#39;t boast the most modern of codebases, but it is still maintained and it can be a great compliment with Umai if you are looking for real code.</p><h2 id="focus-wip" tabindex="-1">Focus (WIP) <a class="header-anchor" href="#focus-wip" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Focus (WIP)&quot;">​</a></h2><p><a href="https://focus.noeldemartin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Focus</a> is the OG, the first app developed with Soukai. However, I wouldn&#39;t recommend looking at the codebase in its current state, because it is very outdated and not even maintained.</p><p>However, the app is being rewritten from scratch, using a nascent framework called <a href="https://aerogel.js.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Aerogel</a> that will be the perfect pairing for Soukai. It&#39;s still a work in progress, but it may be worth looking into the <code>aerogel</code> branch of the repository because it uses a data modeling approach that isn&#39;t as straight-forward as Umai or Media Kraken.</p>',11)]))}const m=a(i,[["render",s]]);export{u as __pageData,m as default};
