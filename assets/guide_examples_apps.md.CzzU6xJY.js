I recently rewrote it using <a href="https://aerogel.js.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Aerogel</a>, a framework I&#39;m working on with Soukai at its core.</p><h2 id="ramen" tabindex="-1">Ramen <a class="header-anchor" href="#ramen" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Ramen&quot;">​</a></h2><p><a href="https://ramen.noeldemartin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Ramen</a> is, quite possibly, the simplest app using Soukai out there. It may even be a stretch to call it &quot;a real app&quot;, but it&#39;s the perfect place to look at how the library can be used in a codebase that is built with production in mind.</p><h2 id="umai" tabindex="-1">Umai <a class="header-anchor" href="#umai" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Umai&quot;">​</a></h2><p><a href="https://umai.noeldemartin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Umai</a> is a local-first recipes manager, and as of this writing (March 2025), it&#39;s the most recent and complete app built with Soukai. If you&#39;re looking for an actual app with a bunch of features, this is the codebase for you.</p><h2 id="media-kraken" tabindex="-1">Media Kraken <a class="header-anchor" href="#media-kraken" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Media Kraken&quot;">​</a></h2><p><a href="https://noeldemartin.github.io/media-kraken/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Media Kraken</a> is a media tracker that was built some years ago. It doesn&#39;t boast the most modern of codebases, but it is still maintained and it can be a great compliment with Umai if you are looking for real code.</p>',10)]))}const d=a(i,[["render",s]]);export{m as __pageData,d as default};
