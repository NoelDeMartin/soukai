# Changelog

## v0.3.0

- Updated functionality related to Soukai 0.3.0 release (relationships, engine interface).
- Replaced `rdflib` dependency with `jsonld-streaming-parser`, `jsonld-streaming-serializer` and `n3`.
- Added default export with `loadSolidModels` method to load models defined by `soukai-solid`.
- Added support for storing multiple models in a single document. [Read the docs](https://github.com/NoelDeMartin/soukai-solid#has-many) and see [SolidModel.test.ts](https://github.com/NoelDeMartin/soukai-solid/blob/v0.3.0/src/models/SolidModel.test.ts) for examples.
- Added new `SolidDocument` model.
- Added helper methods to relation instances. [Read the docs](https://github.com/NoelDeMartin/soukai-solid#relations) to learn more.

### Breaking changes

- Refactored engine document format generated by `SolidModel`, they now generate JSON-LD graphs. Data stored with engines other than `SolidEngine` needs to be migrated in the upgrade. [Read the docs](https://github.com/NoelDeMartin/soukai-solid#solid-models-vs-solid-documents) for details.
- Some method signatures have changed in the `SolidModel` class. Check out those changes here.
- Extracted container functionality to `SolidContainerModel`.
- Made `SolidModel` class abstract (it should always have been).

- Some methods and its arguments have changed, be sure to check out the new [type definitions](https://github.com/NoelDeMartin/soukai-solid/tree/master/types).
- `SolidModel` attributes are now converted to JsonLD before being sent to engines, this is related with a refactor on Soukai 0.2.0 where models have been decoupled from engines.
- `solid-auth-client` dependency has been removed, the `SolidEngine` constructor now takes a function as an argument to interact with Solid PODs.
